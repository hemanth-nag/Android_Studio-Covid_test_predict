# Android_Studio-Covid_test_predict
Simple android app built in Android Studio. The app predicts covid-19 test results.

## **Summary:**

I have been seeing android apps since 2012 but never had a chance to build one... So, just out of curiosity, built this simple app using Android Studio in JAVA(programming language)

This app is the outcome of: [Build Your First Android App (Project-Centered Course) by CentraleSup√©lec](https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-app) taken on Coursera.
The app uses concepts like layouts, web view, image view, media player, etc
